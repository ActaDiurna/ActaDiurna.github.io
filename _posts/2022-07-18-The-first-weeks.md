**The first weeks**.

The Flavian war - and this project - is now in its third week and it is time to look back on what happened so far.

It all begins on **July 1st, AD 69**, when Vespasian is proclaimed emperor by the Egyptian legions. While according to Tacitus it is more of a spontaneous action by the soldiers than the result of intentional planning on the side of Vespasian, that is most certainly Flavian propaganda. In reality, the decision to throw his hat into the ring will have been made beforehand, and the spontaneity of the Egyptian legions was likely very much a staged affair designed to show that Vespasian had enthusiastic support outside his very own army of three legions in Iudaea - and support in one of the most important provinces no less.

A few days later - the exact timeline is speculation, we do not know the precise dates - the legions in Iudaea followed suit, while after another few days the Syrian exercitus also joined the Flavian side. That was a significant development. While the exact force strength of the Iudaean and Syrian legions is difficult to estimate - they cannot have been at full strength, given that they had seen combat, in some cases involving heavy casualties, between 66 and 69 - even eight understrength legions were a force to be reckoned with.

Together with Vespasian the governor of Syria was thrown into the light, or rather stepped boldly into it - but in a graceful, measured way. Gaius Licinius Mucianus is one of the truly great yet far too often overlooked figures of the Flavian war. While Vespasian was a true soldier's general, Mucianus was the prototypical senatorial governor: wealthy beyond measure, extremely well educated, articulate in Latin and Greek - the "magical moment" is actually mentioned by Tacitus -, at the same time full of political cunning and shrewdness yet fully aware of his own limitations. Tacitus has the following to say about the two:

*egregium principatus temperamentum, si demptis utriusque vitiis solae virtutes miscerentur* ("It would have been a rare combination for an emperor if the faults of the two could have been done away with and their virtues only combined in one man")

Which is about as far as praise for an emperor and his main adviser go in Tacitus. Mucianus had the Syrian legions join the Flavian side in Antioch, which should not come as a surprise; Antioch was the main logistics hub for the Roman army in the East, and it was likely also the location of rear echelons of units stationed further to the East. Given the needs of the campaign in Iudaea it is quite possible that the city was awash with soldiers well beyond those normally present

Two other things: one, the news desk at the Acta Diurna loves graphics, figures, diagrams and the lot. More force comparison charts will come, and they raise the legitimate question how realistic they are. Well, the answer is "somewhat, perhaps". The comparison of naval power is probably correct as far as the general capabilities is concerned - the big Italian classes were large, powerful units, the provincial classes were not -, but we do not know how many ships any of these units had at its disposal at any given time. The classis in Misenum had at least one hexeres on strength, a huge warship that probably was the fleet's flagship, while quinqueremes served as the mainstay of that classis. The classis in Ravenna was smaller, but not significantly so, and also had ships larger than triremes on strength. Conversely, provincial classes usually had very few if any triremes available and were largely made up of liburnae, smaller warships used mostly for coastal operations.

The key thing to take away here is that Vespasian did not have a naval option readily at hand. While he had a powerful force under his command, throwing it by sea against Italy was impossible as he did not have the capability to protect any transport fleet he might have gathered. To give that thought some perspective, for carrying only the three legions Vespasian had in Iudaea would have required several hundred transports; trying to go to Italy by sea would therefore have made a lare-scale construction program necessary which in turn would have taken considerable time - time Vitellius could use to prepare for the invasion. 

The other force comparison graphic shows the legions available to Vitellius and Vespasian. This is broken down in cohorts, turmae and artillery pieces of which each legion had 10, 4 and 40 respectively (going by the numbers provided by Vegetius for the legion's artillery, which are problematic, I know). Oh, and I do realize that "ala" is wrong; this will be corrected when a new updated figure comes up. While it is fairly easy to assess the strength of Vespasian' force (or rather it is not, as is unknown how many losses the eastern legions had incurred during three years of fighting in Iudaea), things are more difficult with Vitellius' legions. 

For once, some of those I put into Italy actually had only major vexillations there, while their staff and presumably some personnel was still back at their base. Also, for the time being I only included forces in Italy as these would be the first meeting an enemy intent on striking fast. And finally, all the auxilia are missing. That is actually a major problem as they provided key force elements like cavalry, missile troops etc., but it is simply impossible to estimate the size and composition of the auxiliary units available to either side. This may frustate the modern student of the Flavian war, but one might find at least some consolation in the fact that Tacitus could not have cared less about the auxiliaries. His attitude, which will have been common among Roman senatorial toffs, is best summarized in this sentence covering the losses at the Battle of Mons Graupius:

*legiones pro vallo stetere, ingens victoriae decus citra Romanum sanguinem bellandi, et auxilium, si pellerentur* (Tac. *Agr*. 35)

Which Church and Brodribb translated into:

"The legions were drawn up in front of the intrenched camp; his victory would be vastly more glorious if won without the loss of Roman blood, and he would have a reserve in case of repulse." 

Clearly, Tacitus could not have cared less for Roman auxiliaries - which Agricola put in front of his legionaries. Assuming that the Acta Diurna newsdesk shares that attitude I decided to simply leave the auxiliaries out of the equation. They will have their moment of glory later this year though.

A word about artillery. It is still common to think of the Roman legion as a group of foot soldiers wielding sharp and pointy things. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the Roman legion of the early and high empire was a miniature army whose commanding officer had a vast array of capabilities at his disposal. He had a cavalry element of four turmae for reconnaissance purposes, artillery that was used both for sieges and in open battles, as the war will show, engineering personnel for whom not even the sky was the limit - after all, you could construct a ramp to get closer to it - and sufficient logistics expertise to undertake minor operations with little preparation and larger ones without all the failures usually associated with moving large bodies of soldiers in later centuries. In short, the Roman legion had serious capabilities, and hitting the enemy hard and at long ranges with artillery was an important one. I therefore deliberately included tormenta in the figures.

Apart from the graphics, the newsdesk also loves maps - who doesn't. Therefore I came up with this one:

The map will be updated regularly, but it comes with a number of caveats. It shows the provinces as accurately as possible as they were in AD 69; note for example that at that date the establishment of the provinces of Germania inferior and Germania superior lay still in the future. For each province the capital is given, provided its location is known, and other cities will appear on the map once they become important for the course of events. The map also shows the location of the legions and classes, though the legions are only located in their respective provinces; the symbols do not represent the actual location of the garrison. What the map does not show is the location of auxiliary units. As noted above that poses a major problem, and instead of wildly guessing about numbers and location I decided to simply leave them out. Again, from a military point of view that is, well, unfortunate, but Tacitus would have agreed.

A final note on Acta Diurna's resident expert for all matters military: Sextus Laecanius Naevius Labio. His name and rank appear on a piece of piping (CIL XV 7244: (centurionis) coh(ortis) VIIII pr(aetoriae)) that is dated to the second half of the first century AD. Tantalizingly, there is another inscription from Sardinia, which refers to a Sextus Laecanius Labeo as the governor of the province of Sardinia. That inscription, CIL III 7368, can be dated to AD 83 and is dedicated to emperor Domitian. 

While there is no conclusive proof that the two Laecanii Labeones were one and the same person, I like the idea quite a bit. It would mean that our centurio had started his career under Nero, managed to get through the Year of the Four Emperors unscathed and eventually had a successful career under the Flavians. This highlights an important yet all to often overlooked fact: while civil wars like that of AD 69 tend to cause disruption in the line of emperors, that disruption does not necessarily extend to the functional elites below the level of the emperors and their innermost circle. It was perfectly possible to start one's career under one emperor and then continue it under a successor who was not on best terms with his predecessor. Flavius Sabinus whom we have looked at above is another good example. Of course, this requires a certain amount of opportunism, particularly in a situation like that of AD 69, and our centurio is currently firmly in the camp of Vitellius. We'll see how that changes over the course of the usurpation.

So much for now. In the coming weeks we will see how the Flavian usurpation spreads like wildfire throughout the Eastern provinces, soon creating problems for Vitellius.
